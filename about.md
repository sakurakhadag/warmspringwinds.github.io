Hi, I am Daniil Pakhomov, PhD student at Johns Hopkins University. 
My main research interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Machine Learning.
To be more specific, I focus on Object Detection and Segmentation in general and
for Medical Images.


This blog was originally created to post my progress in [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] project
for [Scikit-image open source image processing library][skimage] in implementing Face Detection algorithm.
