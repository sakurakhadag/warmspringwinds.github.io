Hi, I am Daniil Pakhomov, a master student at Technical University of Munich
and a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University.

I am studying Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
This blog was originally created to post my progress in [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] project
for [Scikit-image open source image processing library][skimage] in implementing Face Detection algorithm.
